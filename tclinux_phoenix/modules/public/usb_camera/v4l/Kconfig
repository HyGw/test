	  compile or work correctly on your kernel, which is too old.

	  Support for TM5600/TM6000/TM6010 USB Device

	  Since these cards have no MPEG decoder onboard, they transmit
	  only compressed MPEG data over the usb bus, so you need
	  an external software decoder to watch TV on your computer.

	  Say Y if you own such a device and want to use it.
