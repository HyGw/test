PLEASE REPORT NEW DEVICES !



This is a data package to complement the full release package of
USB_ModeSwitch, a tool to switch multi-mode USB devices.
It is used since usb-modeswitch version 1.0.3.

Recommended version of usb-modeswitch package is 1.1.4 and above. Some
devices contained here may not be switched with older versions, even if
they will not cause any error.


Tasks initiated by the rules file:
==================================

- call wrapper to initiate switching for known devices when plugged in
  (starting from version 1.1.4 at boot time too)

- adding symlink "gsmmodem" to appropriate connection port (out of 2-5
  ports provided by some devices); this is only a help for handling and
  NOT needed for switching to work.
  This action will be done for known modems only (at least switched once
  on this system)

- loading and binding the "option" driver if the device arrives in modem
  state (not CDC/ACM!) and the device ID is not yet known to the driver.
  This action will be done for known modems only (at least switched once
  on this system)


Explanation about config file names:
====================================

Names consist of <VendorID>:<ProductID>, respective to the default device
mode.
Should more detailed identification become necessary, one or more attributes
to test can be attached after further colons:
<VendorID>:<ProductID>:<Attribute>=<String>[:<Attribute>=<String> ...]

The strings match if they are part of the attribute content. Use "_"
to match spaces (it will match "_" too!).

Currently recognized attibutes are:

uMa = USB, iManufacturer
uPr = USB, iProduct
uSe = USB, iSerial
sVe = SCSI, Vendor
sMo = SCSI, Model
sRe = SCSI, Revision

This list is easily extendable if necessary.

Example:
<vid>:<pid>:uPr=CDMA_Mo will match iProduct "CDMA Modem" or "MyCDMA_Mordor"


If information is missing about ambiguous devices, a ":?" is attached
to the file/ID in question. Please contact the forum if you need help
in such a case.


Parameters used only in config files:
=====================================

These are not evaluated by the binary but by the wrapper.

WaitBefore=<seconds>		delay the switching process

DriverModule=<module name>	load a specific driver module after switch

DriverIDPath=<path to attribute>
				if the driver has the ability to add new device IDs
				on-the-fly, this is the file node to use.
				Example: "/sys/bus/usb-serial/drivers/option1/new_id"



Notes about specific devices:
=============================

- 16d8:6803 (C-motech D50, CDU-680): two versions popped up; one with
  ID unchanged, target class 0xff, providing standard serial ports,
  and one with target product 0x680a, providing an ACM port. There is
  not enough information how to tell them apart; if you have the second
  one, we badly need information (usb_modeswitch output with SCSI inquiry)

- 1004:607f (LG KP500): switching message derived from report but untested

- 1266:1000 (Royaltek Q110): switching method very likely but unconfirmed

- 1a8d:1000 (BandLuxe): now just one config for all devices; the new parameter
  "ReleaseDelay" will improve ambiguous behaviour on older systems

- Some WiMAX and LTE devices are included since 20101222; for most of these
  there are no working Linux drivers available yet. Efforts are underway.
  Stand by or search for "staging drivers".

- 05c6:2000 (unnamed HSDPA modem from "dealextreme"): unusually long switching
  time, even with MS Windoze - 30 to 40 seconds. Don't be alarmed.

- 0471:1210 (Philips chipset): had to be split after variants with different
  targets and behaviour appeared. This is not properly tested yet, please
  report problems.
