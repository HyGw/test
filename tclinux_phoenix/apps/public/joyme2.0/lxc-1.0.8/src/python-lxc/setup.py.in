# Distutils doesn't cope well with source files that have relative paths going
# up in the directory tree: it tries to navigate outside of the build dir and
# fails miserably. Therefore, we will instead cd to the source directory,
# run this script from there, but write the build products to the correct path.
#
# Since we will be changing directories before building, we must transform
# all the path variables to their forms relative to srcdir.
