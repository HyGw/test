.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBIp6tables\fP is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the
tables of IPv6 packet
filter rules in the Linux kernel.  Several different tables
may be defined.  Each table contains a number of built-in
chains and may also contain user-defined chains.
.PP
Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.  Each
rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches.  This is called
a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same
table.
.SH TARGETS
A firewall rule specifies criteria for a packet and a target.  If the
packet does not match, the next rule in the chain is the examined; if
it does match, then the next rule is specified by the value of the
target, which can be the name of a user-defined chain or one of the
special values \fBACCEPT\fP, \fBDROP\fP, \fBQUEUE\fP or \fBRETURN\fP.
.PP
\fBACCEPT\fP means to let the packet through.
\fBDROP\fP means to drop the packet on the floor.
\fBQUEUE\fP means to pass the packet to userspace.
(How the packet can be received
by a userspace process differs by the particular queue handler.  2.4.x
and 2.6.x kernels up to 2.6.13 include the \fBip_queue\fP
queue handler.  Kernels 2.6.14 and later additionally include the
\fBnfnetlink_queue\fP queue handler.  Packets with a target of QUEUE will be
sent to queue number '0' in this case. Please also see the \fBNFQUEUE\fP
target as described later in this man page.)
\fBRETURN\fP means stop traversing this chain and resume at the next
rule in the
previous (calling) chain.  If the end of a built-in chain is reached
or a rule in a built-in chain with target \fBRETURN\fP
is matched, the target specified by the chain policy determines the
fate of the packet.
.SH TABLES
There are currently three independent tables (which tables are present
at any time depends on the kernel configuration options and which
modules are present).
.TP
\fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-table\fP \fItable\fP
This option specifies the packet matching table which the command
should operate on.  If the kernel is configured with automatic module
loading, an attempt will be made to load the appropriate module for
that table if it is not already there.

The tables are as follows:
.RS
.TP .4i
\fBfilter\fP:
This is the default table (if no \-t option is passed). It contains
the built-in chains \fBINPUT\fP (for packets destined to local sockets),
\fBFORWARD\fP (for packets being routed through the box), and
\fBOUTPUT\fP (for locally-generated packets).
.TP
\fBmangle\fP:
This table is used for specialized packet alteration.  Until kernel
2.4.17 it had two built-in chains: \fBPREROUTING\fP
(for altering incoming packets before routing) and \fBOUTPUT\fP
(for altering locally-generated packets before routing).
Since kernel 2.4.18, three other built-in chains are also supported:
\fBINPUT\fP (for packets coming into the box itself), \fBFORWARD\fP
(for altering packets being routed through the box), and \fBPOSTROUTING\fP
(for altering packets as they are about to go out).
.TP
\fBraw\fP:
This table is used mainly for configuring exemptions from connection
tracking in combination with the NOTRACK target.  It registers at the netfilter
hooks with higher priority and is thus called before ip_conntrack, or any other
IP tables.  It provides the following built-in chains: \fBPREROUTING\fP
(for packets arriving via any network interface) \fBOUTPUT\fP
(for packets generated by local processes)
.RE
.SH OPTIONS
The options that are recognized by
\fBip6tables\fP can be divided into several different groups.
.SS COMMANDS
These options specify the specific action to perform.  Only one of them
can be specified on the command line unless otherwise specified
below.  For all the long versions of the command and option names, you
need to use only enough letters to ensure that
\fBip6tables\fP can differentiate it from all other options.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP, \fB\-\-append\fP \fIchain rule-specification\fP
Append one or more rules to the end of the selected chain.
When the source and/or destination names resolve to more than one
address, a rule will be added for each possible address combination.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP, \fB\-\-delete\fP \fIchain rule-specification\fP
.ns
.TP
\fB\-D\fP, \fB\-\-delete\fP \fIchain rulenum\fP
Delete one or more rules from the selected chain.  There are two
versions of this command: the rule can be specified as a number in the
chain (starting at 1 for the first rule) or a rule to match.
.TP
\fB\-I\fP, \fB\-\-insert\fP \fIchain\fP [\fIrulenum\fP] \fIrule-specification\fP
Insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule
number.  So, if the rule number is 1, the rule or rules are inserted
at the head of the chain.  This is also the default if no rule number
is specified.
.TP
\fB\-R\fP, \fB\-\-replace\fP \fIchain rulenum rule-specification\fP
Replace a rule in the selected chain.  If the source and/or
destination names resolve to multiple addresses, the command will
fail.  Rules are numbered starting at 1.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP, \fB\-\-list\fP [\fIchain\fP]
List all rules in the selected chain.  If no chain is selected, all
chains are listed. Like every other ip6tables command, it applies to the
specified table (filter is the default).
.IP ""
Please note that it is often used with the \fB\-n\fP
option, in order to avoid long reverse DNS lookups.
It is legal to specify the \fB\-Z\fP
(zero) option as well, in which case the chain(s) will be atomically
listed and zeroed.  The exact output is affected by the other
arguments given. The exact rules are suppressed until you use
.nf
 ip6tables \-L \-v
.fi
.TP
\fB\-S\fP, \fB\-\-list\-rules\fP [\fIchain\fP]
Print all rules in the selected chain.  If no chain is selected, all
chains are printed like ip6tables-save. Like every other ip6tables command,
it applies to the specified table (filter is the default).
.TP
\fB\-F\fP, \fB\-\-flush\fP [\fIchain\fP]
Flush the selected chain (all the chains in the table if none is given).
This is equivalent to deleting all the rules one by one.
.TP
\fB\-Z\fP, \fB\-\-zero\fP [\fIchain\fP [\fIrulenum\fP]]
Zero the packet and byte counters in all chains, or only the given chain,
or only the given rule in a chain. It is legal to
specify the
\fB\-L\fP, \fB\-\-list\fP
(list) option as well, to see the counters immediately before they are
cleared. (See above.)
.TP
\fB\-N\fP, \fB\-\-new\-chain\fP \fIchain\fP
Create a new user-defined chain by the given name.  There must be no
target of that name already.
.TP
\fB\-X\fP, \fB\-\-delete\-chain\fP [\fIchain\fP]
Delete the optional user-defined chain specified.  There must be no references
to the chain.  If there are, you must delete or replace the referring rules
before the chain can be deleted.  The chain must be empty, i.e. not contain
any rules.  If no argument is given, it will attempt to delete every
non-builtin chain in the table.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP, \fB\-\-policy\fP \fIchain target\fP
Set the policy for the chain to the given target.  See the section \fBTARGETS\fP
for the legal targets.  Only built-in (non-user-defined) chains can have
policies, and neither built-in nor user-defined chains can be policy
targets.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP, \fB\-\-rename\-chain\fP \fIold\-chain new\-chain\fP
Rename the user specified chain to the user supplied name.  This is
cosmetic, and has no effect on the structure of the table.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP, \fB\-\-append\fP \fIchain rule-specification\fP
Append one or more rules to the end of the selected chain.
When the source and/or destination names resolve to more than one
address, a rule will be added for each possible address combination.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Help.
Give a (currently very brief) description of the command syntax.
.SS PARAMETERS
The following parameters make up a rule specification (as used in the
add, delete, insert, replace and append commands).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-protocol\fP \fIprotocol\fP
The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check.
The specified protocol can be one of \fBtcp\fP, \fBudp\fP, \fBudplite\fP,
\fBicmpv6\fP, \fBesp\fP, \fBmh\fP or \fBall\fP,
or it can be a numeric value, representing one of these protocols or a
different one. A protocol name from /etc/protocols is also allowed.
But IPv6 extension headers except \fBesp\fP are not allowed.
\fBesp\fP and \fBipv6\-nonext\fP
can be used with Kernel version 2.6.11 or later.
A "!" argument before the protocol inverts the
test.  The number zero is equivalent to \fBall\fP.
Protocol \fBall\fP
will match with all protocols and is taken as default when this
option is omitted.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-s\fP, \fB\-\-source\fP \fIaddress\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Source specification.
\fIAddress\fP can be either be a hostname,
a network IP address (with \fB/\fP\fImask\fP), or a plain IP address.
Names will be resolved once only, before the rule is submitted to the kernel.
Please note that specifying any name to be resolved with a remote query such as
DNS is a really bad idea.
(Resolving network names is not supported at this time.)
The \fImask\fP is a plain number,
specifying the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask.
A "!" argument before the address specification inverts the sense of
the address. The flag \fB\-\-src\fP
is an alias for this option.
Multiple addresses can be specified, but this will \fBexpand to multiple
rules\fP (when adding with \-A), or will cause multiple rules to be
deleted (with \-D).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-destination\fP \fIaddress\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Destination specification. 
See the description of the \fB\-s\fP
(source) flag for a detailed description of the syntax.  The flag
\fB\-\-dst\fP is an alias for this option.
.TP
\fB\-j\fP, \fB\-\-jump\fP \fItarget\fP
This specifies the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if the packet
matches it.  The target can be a user-defined chain (other than the
one this rule is in), one of the special builtin targets which decide
the fate of the packet immediately, or an extension (see \fBEXTENSIONS\fP
below).  If this
option is omitted in a rule (and \fB\-g\fP
is not used), then matching the rule will have no
effect on the packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will be
incremented.
.TP
\fB\-g\fP, \fB\-\-goto\fP \fIchain\fP
This specifies that the processing should continue in a user
specified chain. Unlike the \-\-jump option return will not continue
processing in this chain but instead in the chain that called us via
\-\-jump.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-i\fP, \fB\-\-in\-interface\fP \fIname\fP
Name of an interface via which a packet was received (only for
packets entering the \fBINPUT\fP, \fBFORWARD\fP and \fBPREROUTING\fP
chains).  When the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the
sense is inverted.  If the interface name ends in a "+", then any
interface which begins with this name will match.  If this option is
omitted, any interface name will match.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-out\-interface\fP \fIname\fP
Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for packets
entering the \fBFORWARD\fP, \fBOUTPUT\fP and \fBPOSTROUTING\fP
chains).  When the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the
sense is inverted.  If the interface name ends in a "+", then any
interface which begins with this name will match.  If this option is
omitted, any interface name will match.
.\" Currently not supported (header-based)
.\" .TP
.\" [\fB!\fP] \fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-fragment\fP
.\" This means that the rule only refers to second and further fragments
.\" of fragmented packets.  Since there is no way to tell the source or
.\" destination ports of such a packet (or ICMP type), such a packet will
.\" not match any rules which specify them.  When the "!" argument
.\" precedes the "\-f" flag, the rule will only match head fragments, or
.\" unfragmented packets.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-set\-counters\fP \fIpackets bytes\fP
This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte
counters of a rule (during \fBINSERT\fP, \fBAPPEND\fP, \fBREPLACE\fP
operations).
.SS "OTHER OPTIONS"
The following additional options can be specified:
.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
Verbose output.  This option makes the list command show the interface
name, the rule options (if any), and the TOS masks.  The packet and
byte counters are also listed, with the suffix 'K', 'M' or 'G' for
1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 multipliers respectively (but see
the \fB\-x\fP flag to change this).
For appending, insertion, deletion and replacement, this causes
detailed information on the rule or rules to be printed.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-numeric\fP
Numeric output.
IP addresses and port numbers will be printed in numeric format.
By default, the program will try to display them as host names,
network names, or services (whenever applicable).
.TP
\fB\-x\fP, \fB\-\-exact\fP
Expand numbers.
Display the exact value of the packet and byte counters,
instead of only the rounded number in K's (multiples of 1000)
M's (multiples of 1000K) or G's (multiples of 1000M).  This option is
only relevant for the \fB\-L\fP command.
.TP
\fB\-\-line\-numbers\fP
When listing rules, add line numbers to the beginning of each rule,
corresponding to that rule's position in the chain.
.TP
\fB\-\-modprobe=\fP\fIcommand\fP
When adding or inserting rules into a chain, use \fIcommand\fP
to load any necessary modules (targets, match extensions, etc).
.SH MATCH EXTENSIONS
ip6tables can use extended packet matching modules.  These are loaded
in two ways: implicitly, when \fB\-p\fP or \fB\-\-protocol\fP
is specified, or with the \fB\-m\fP or \fB\-\-match\fP
options, followed by the matching module name; after these, various
extra command line options become available, depending on the specific
module.  You can specify multiple extended match modules in one line,
and you can use the \fB\-h\fP or \fB\-\-help\fP
options after the module has been specified to receive help specific
to that module.
.PP
The following are included in the base package, and most of these can
be preceded by a "\fB!\fP" to invert the sense of the match.
.\" @MATCH@
.SS ah
This module matches the parameters in Authentication header of IPsec packets.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-ahspi\fP \fIspi\fP[\fB:\fP\fIspi\fP]
Matches SPI.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-ahlen\fP \fIlength\fP
Total length of this header in octets.
.TP
\fB\-\-ahres\fP
Matches if the reserved field is filled with zero.
.SS cluster
Allows you to deploy gateway and back-end load-sharing clusters without the
need of load-balancers.
.PP
This match requires that all the nodes see the same packets. Thus, the cluster
match decides if this node has to handle a packet given the following options:
.TP
\fB\-\-cluster\-total\-nodes\fP \fInum\fP
Set number of total nodes in cluster.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-cluster\-local\-node\fP \fInum\fP
Set the local node number ID.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-cluster\-local\-nodemask\fP \fImask\fP
Set the local node number ID mask. You can use this option instead
of \fB\-\-cluster\-local\-node\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-cluster\-hash\-seed\fP \fIvalue\fP
Set seed value of the Jenkins hash.
.PP
Example:
.IP
iptables \-A PREROUTING \-t mangle \-i eth1 \-m cluster
\-\-cluster\-total\-nodes 2 \-\-cluster\-local\-node 1
\-\-cluster\-hash\-seed 0xdeadbeef
\-j MARK \-\-set-mark 0xffff
.IP
iptables \-A PREROUTING \-t mangle \-i eth2 \-m cluster
\-\-cluster\-total\-nodes 2 \-\-cluster\-local\-node 1
\-\-cluster\-hash\-seed 0xdeadbeef
\-j MARK -\-set\-mark 0xffff
.IP
iptables \-A PREROUTING \-t mangle \-i eth1
\-m mark ! \-\-mark 0xffff \-j DROP
.IP
iptables \-A PREROUTING \-t mangle \-i eth2
\-m mark ! \-\-mark 0xffff \-j DROP
.PP
And the following commands to make all nodes see the same packets:
.IP
ip maddr add 01:00:5e:00:01:01 dev eth1
.IP
ip maddr add 01:00:5e:00:01:02 dev eth2
.IP

\-j mangle \-\-mangle-mac-s 01:00:5e:00:01:01
.IP
arptables \-A INPUT \-i eth1 \-\-h-length 6
\-\-destination-mac 01:00:5e:00:01:01
\-j mangle \-\-mangle\-mac\-d 00:zz:yy:xx:5a:27
.IP
arptables \-A OUTPUT \-o eth2 \-\-h\-length 6

\-\-destination\-mac 01:00:5e:00:01:02
\-j mangle \-\-mangle\-mac\-d 00:zz:yy:xx:5a:27
.PP
In the case of TCP connections, pickup facility has to be disabled
to avoid marking TCP ACK packets coming in the reply direction as
valid.
.IP
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp_loose
.SS comment
Allows you to add comments (up to 256 characters) to any rule.
.TP
\fB\-\-comment\fP \fIcomment\fP
.TP
Example:
iptables \-A INPUT \-i eth1 \-m comment \-\-comment "my local LAN"
.SS connbytes
Match by how many bytes or packets a connection (or one of the two
flows constituting the connection) has transferred so far, or by
average bytes per packet.
.PP
The counters are 64-bit and are thus not expected to overflow ;)
.PP
The primary use is to detect long-lived downloads and mark them to be
scheduled using a lower priority band in traffic control.
.PP
The transferred bytes per connection can also be viewed through
`conntrack \-L` and accessed via ctnetlink.
.PP
NOTE that for connections which have no accounting information, the match will
always return false. The "net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct" sysctl flag controls
whether \fBnew\fP connections will be byte/packet counted. Existing connection
flows will not be gaining/losing a/the accounting structure when be sysctl flag
is flipped.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-connbytes\fP \fIfrom\fP[\fB:\fP\fIto\fP]
match packets from a connection whose packets/bytes/average packet
size is more than FROM and less than TO bytes/packets. if TO is
omitted only FROM check is done. "!" is used to match packets not
falling in the range.
.TP
\fB\-\-connbytes\-dir\fP {\fBoriginal\fP|\fBreply\fP|\fBboth\fP}
which packets to consider
.TP
\fB\-\-connbytes\-mode\fP {\fBpackets\fP|\fBbytes\fP|\fBavgpkt\fP}
whether to check the amount of packets, number of bytes transferred or
the average size (in bytes) of all packets received so far. Note that
when "both" is used together with "avgpkt", and data is going (mainly)
only in one direction (for example HTTP), the average packet size will
be about half of the actual data packets.
.TP
Example:
iptables .. \-m connbytes \-\-connbytes 10000:100000 \-\-connbytes\-dir both \-\-connbytes\-mode bytes ...
.SS connlimit
Allows you to restrict the number of parallel connections to a server per
client IP address (or client address block).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-connlimit\-above\fP \fIn\fP
Match if the number of existing connections is (not) above \fIn\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-connlimit\-mask\fP \fIprefix_length\fP
Group hosts using the prefix length. For IPv4, this must be a number between
(including) 0 and 32. For IPv6, between 0 and 128.
.P
Examples:
.TP
# allow 2 telnet connections per client host
iptables \-A INPUT \-p tcp \-\-syn \-\-dport 23 \-m connlimit \-\-connlimit\-above 2 \-j REJECT
.TP
# you can also match the other way around:
iptables \-A INPUT \-p tcp \-\-syn \-\-dport 23 \-m connlimit ! \-\-connlimit\-above 2 \-j ACCEPT
.TP
# limit the number of parallel HTTP requests to 16 per class C sized \
network (24 bit netmask)
iptables \-p tcp \-\-syn \-\-dport 80 \-m connlimit \-\-connlimit\-above 16
\-\-connlimit\-mask 24 \-j REJECT
.TP
# limit the number of parallel HTTP requests to 16 for the link local network
(ipv6)
ip6tables \-p tcp \-\-syn \-\-dport 80 \-s fe80::/64 \-m connlimit \-\-connlimit\-above
16 \-\-connlimit\-mask 64 \-j REJECT
.SS connmark
This module matches the netfilter mark field associated with a connection
(which can be set using the \fBCONNMARK\fP target below).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-mark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Matches packets in connections with the given mark value (if a mask is
specified, this is logically ANDed with the mark before the comparison).
.SS conntrack
This module, when combined with connection tracking, allows access to the
connection tracking state for this packet/connection.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-ctstate\fP \fIstatelist\fP
\fIstatelist\fP is a comma separated list of the connection states to match.
Possible states are listed below.

expensive of doing the hash housekeeping.
.TP
\fB\-\-hashlimit\-srcmask\fP \fIprefix\fP
When \-\-hashlimit\-mode srcip is used, all source addresses encountered will be
grouped according to the given prefix length and the so-created subnet will be
subject to hashlimit. \fIprefix\fP must be between (inclusive) 0 and 32. Note

Match if the source port is one of the given ports.  The flag
\fB\-\-sports\fP
is a convenient alias for this option. Multiple ports or port ranges are
separated using a comma, and a port range is specified using a colon.
\fB53,1024:65535\fP would therefore match ports 53 and all from 1024 through
65535.
.TP

Match if either the source or destination ports are equal to one of
the given ports.
.SS owner
This module attempts to match various characteristics of the packet creator,
for locally generated packets. This match is only valid in the OUTPUT and
POSTROUTING chains. Forwarded packets do not have any socket associated with
them. Packets from kernel threads do have a socket, but usually no owner.
.TP

Name of a bridge port via which a packet is received (only for
packets entering the
.BR INPUT ,
.B FORWARD
and
.B PREROUTING
chains). If the interface name ends in a "+", then any
interface which begins with this name will match. If the packet didn't arrive
through a bridge device, this packet won't match this option, unless '!' is used.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-physdev\-out\fP \fIname\fP
Name of a bridge port via which a packet is going to be sent (for packets
entering the
.BR FORWARD ,
.B OUTPUT
and
.B POSTROUTING
chains).  If the interface name ends in a "+", then any
interface which begins with this name will match. Note that in the
.BR nat " and " mangle
.B OUTPUT
chains one cannot match on the bridge output port, however one can in the
.B "filter OUTPUT"
chain. If the packet won't leave by a bridge device or if it is yet unknown what
the output device will be, then the packet won't match this option,
unless '!' is used.

.SS recent
Allows you to dynamically create a list of IP addresses and then match against
that list in a few different ways.
.PP
For example, you can create a "badguy" list out of people attempting to connect
to port 139 on your firewall and then DROP all future packets from them without
considering them.
.PP
\fB\-\-set\fP, \fB\-\-rcheck\fP, \fB\-\-update\fP and \fB\-\-remove\fP are
mutually exclusive.
.TP
\fB\-\-name\fP \fIname\fP
Specify the list to use for the commands. If no name is given then
\fBDEFAULT\fP will be used.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-set\fP
This will add the source address of the packet to the list. If the source
address is already in the list, this will update the existing entry. This will
always return success (or failure if \fB!\fP is passed in).
.TP
\fB\-\-rsource\fP
Match/save the source address of each packet in the recent list table. This
is the default.
.TP
\fB\-\-rdest\fP
Match/save the destination address of each packet in the recent list table.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-rcheck\fP
Check if the source address of the packet is currently in the list.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-update\fP
Like \fB\-\-rcheck\fP, except it will update the "last seen" timestamp if it
matches.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-remove\fP
Check if the source address of the packet is currently in the list and if so
that address will be removed from the list and the rule will return true. If
the address is not found, false is returned.
.TP
\fB\-\-seconds\fP \fIseconds\fP
This option must be used in conjunction with one of \fB\-\-rcheck\fP or
\fB\-\-update\fP. When used, this will narrow the match to only happen when the
address is in the list and was seen within the last given number of seconds.
.TP
\fB\-\-hitcount\fP \fIhits\fP
This option must be used in conjunction with one of \fB\-\-rcheck\fP or
\fB\-\-update\fP. When used, this will narrow the match to only happen when the
address is in the list and packets had been received greater than or equal to
the given value. This option may be used along with \fB\-\-seconds\fP to create
an even narrower match requiring a certain number of hits within a specific
time frame. The maximum value for the hitcount parameter is given by the
"ip_pkt_list_tot" parameter of the xt_recent kernel module. Exceeding this
value on the command line will cause the rule to be rejected.
.TP
\fB\-\-rttl\fP
This option may only be used in conjunction with one of \fB\-\-rcheck\fP or
\fB\-\-update\fP. When used, this will narrow the match to only happen when the
address is in the list and the TTL of the current packet matches that of the
packet which hit the \fB\-\-set\fP rule. This may be useful if you have problems
with people faking their source address in order to DoS you via this module by
disallowing others access to your site by sending bogus packets to you.

Steve's ipt_recent website (http://snowman.net/projects/ipt_recent/) also has
some examples of usage.
.PP
\fB/proc/net/xt_recent/*\fP are the current lists of addresses and information
about each entry of each list.
.PP
Each file in \fB/proc/net/xt_recent/\fP can be read from to see the current
list or written two using the following commands to modify the list:
.TP
\fBecho +\fP\fIaddr\fP\fB >/proc/net/xt_recent/DEFAULT\fP
to add \fIaddr\fP to the DEFAULT list
.TP
\fBecho \-\fP\fIaddr\fP\fB >/proc/net/xt_recent/DEFAULT\fP
to remove \fIaddr\fP from the DEFAULT list
.TP
\fBecho / >/proc/net/xt_recent/DEFAULT\fP
to flush the DEFAULT list (remove all entries).
.PP
The module itself accepts parameters, defaults shown:
.TP
\fBip_list_tot\fP=\fI100\fP
Number of addresses remembered per table.
.TP
\fBip_pkt_list_tot\fP=\fI20\fP
Number of packets per address remembered.
.TP
\fBip_list_hash_size\fP=\fI0\fP
Hash table size. 0 means to calculate it based on ip_list_tot, default: 512.
.TP
\fBip_list_perms\fP=\fI0644\fP
Permissions for /proc/net/xt_recent/* files.
.TP
\fBip_list_uid\fP=\fI0\fP
Numerical UID for ownership of /proc/net/xt_recent/* files.
.TP
\fBip_list_gid\fP=\fI0\fP

.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-rt\-type\fP \fItype\fP
Match the type (numeric).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-rt\-segsleft\fP \fInum\fP[\fB:\fP\fInum\fP]
Match the `segments left' field (range).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-rt\-len\fP \fIlength\fP
Match the length of this header.
.TP
\fB\-\-rt\-0\-res\fP
Match the reserved field, too (type=0)
.TP
\fB\-\-rt\-0\-addrs\fP \fIaddr\fP[\fB,\fP\fIaddr\fP...]
Match type=0 addresses (list).
.TP
\fB\-\-rt\-0\-not\-strict\fP
List of type=0 addresses is not a strict list.

.SS set
This module matches IP sets which can be defined by ipset(8).
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-match\-set\fP \fIsetname\fP \fIflag\fP[\fB,\fP\fIflag\fP]...
where flags are the comma separated list of
.BR "src"
and/or
.BR "dst" 
specifications and there can be no more than six of them. Hence the command
.IP
 iptables \-A FORWARD \-m set \-\-match\-set test src,dst
.IP
will match packets, for which (if the set type is ipportmap) the source
address and destination port pair can be found in the specified set. If
the set type of the specified set is single dimension (for example ipmap),
then the command will match packets for which the source address can be
found in the specified set. 
.PP
The option \fB\-\-match\-set\fP can be replaced by \fB\-\-set\fP if that does 
not clash with an option of other extensions.
.PP
Use of -m set requires that ipset kernel support is provided. As standard
kernels do not ship this currently, the ipset or Xtables-addons package needs
to be installed.
.SS state
This module, when combined with connection tracking, allows access to
the connection tracking state for this packet.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-state\fP \fIstate\fP
Where state is a comma separated list of the connection states to
match.  Possible states are
.B INVALID
meaning that the packet could not be identified for some reason which
includes running out of memory and ICMP errors which don't correspond to any
known connection,
.B ESTABLISHED
meaning that the packet is associated with a connection which has seen
packets in both directions,
.B NEW
meaning that the packet has started a new connection, or otherwise
associated with a connection which has not seen packets in both
directions, and
.B RELATED
meaning that the packet is starting a new connection, but is
associated with an existing connection, such as an FTP data transfer,
or an ICMP error.
.B UNTRACKED
meaning that the packet is not tracked at all, which happens if you use
the NOTRACK target in raw table.
.SS statistic
This module matches packets based on some statistic condition.
It supports two distinct modes settable with the 
\fB\-\-mode\fP
option.
.PP
Supported options:
.TP
\fB\-\-mode\fP \fImode\fP
Set the matching mode of the matching rule, supported modes are
.B random
and
.B nth. 
.TP
\fB\-\-probability\fP \fIp\fP
Set the probability from 0 to 1 for a packet to be randomly
matched. It works only with the
.B random
mode.
.TP
\fB\-\-every\fP \fIn\fP
Match one packet every nth packet. It works only with the
.B nth
mode (see also the 
\fB\-\-packet\fP
option).
.TP
\fB\-\-packet\fP \fIp\fP
Set the initial counter value (0 <= p <= n\-1, default 0) for the
.B nth 
mode.
.SS string
This modules matches a given string by using some pattern matching strategy. It requires a linux kernel >= 2.6.14.
.TP
\fB\-\-algo\fP {\fBbm\fP|\fBkmp\fP}
Select the pattern matching strategy. (bm = Boyer-Moore, kmp = Knuth-Pratt-Morris)
.TP
\fB\-\-from\fP \fIoffset\fP
Set the offset from which it starts looking for any matching. If not passed, default is 0.
.TP
\fB\-\-to\fP \fIoffset\fP
Set the offset up to which should be scanned. That is, byte \fIoffset\fP-1
(counting from 0) is the last one that is scanned.
If not passed, default is the packet size.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-string\fP \fIpattern\fP
Matches the given pattern.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-hex\-string\fP \fIpattern\fP
Matches the given pattern in hex notation.
.SS tcp
These extensions can be used if `\-\-protocol tcp' is specified. It
provides the following options:
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-source\-port\fP,\fB\-\-sport\fP \fIport\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP]
Source port or port range specification. This can either be a service
name or a port number. An inclusive range can also be specified,
using the format \fIfirst\fP\fB:\fP\fIlast\fP.
If the first port is omitted, "0" is assumed; if the last is omitted,
"65535" is assumed.
If the first port is greater than the second one they will be swapped.
The flag
\fB\-\-sport\fP
is a convenient alias for this option.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-destination\-port\fP,\fB\-\-dport\fP \fIport\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP]
Destination port or port range specification.  The flag
\fB\-\-dport\fP
is a convenient alias for this option.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-tcp\-flags\fP \fImask\fP \fIcomp\fP
Match when the TCP flags are as specified.  The first argument \fImask\fP is the
flags which we should examine, written as a comma-separated list, and
the second argument \fIcomp\fP is a comma-separated list of flags which must be
set.  Flags are:
.BR "SYN ACK FIN RST URG PSH ALL NONE" .
Hence the command
.nf
 iptables \-A FORWARD \-p tcp \-\-tcp\-flags SYN,ACK,FIN,RST SYN
.fi
will only match packets with the SYN flag set, and the ACK, FIN and
RST flags unset.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-syn\fP
Only match TCP packets with the SYN bit set and the ACK,RST and FIN bits
cleared.  Such packets are used to request TCP connection initiation;
for example, blocking such packets coming in an interface will prevent
incoming TCP connections, but outgoing TCP connections will be
unaffected.
It is equivalent to \fB\-\-tcp\-flags SYN,RST,ACK,FIN SYN\fP.
If the "!" flag precedes the "\-\-syn", the sense of the
option is inverted.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-tcp\-option\fP \fInumber\fP
Match if TCP option set.
.SS tcpmss
This matches the TCP MSS (maximum segment size) field of the TCP header.  You can only use this on TCP SYN or SYN/ACK packets, since the MSS is only negotiated during the TCP handshake at connection startup time.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-mss\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP]
Match a given TCP MSS value or range.
.SS time
This matches if the packet arrival time/date is within a given range. All
options are optional, but are ANDed when specified.
.TP
\fB\-\-datestart\fP \fIYYYY\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIMM\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIDD\fP[\fBT\fP\fIhh\fP[\fB:\fP\fImm\fP[\fB:\fP\fIss\fP]]]]]
.TP
\fB\-\-datestop\fP \fIYYYY\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIMM\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIDD\fP[\fBT\fP\fIhh\fP[\fB:\fP\fImm\fP[\fB:\fP\fIss\fP]]]]]
.IP
Only match during the given time, which must be in ISO 8601 "T" notation.
The possible time range is 1970-01-01T00:00:00 to 2038-01-19T04:17:07.
.IP
If \-\-datestart or \-\-datestop are not specified, it will default to 1970-01-01
and 2038-01-19, respectively.
.TP
\fB\-\-timestart\fP \fIhh\fP\fB:\fP\fImm\fP[\fB:\fP\fIss\fP]
.TP
\fB\-\-timestop\fP \fIhh\fP\fB:\fP\fImm\fP[\fB:\fP\fIss\fP]
.IP
Only match during the given daytime. The possible time range is 00:00:00 to
23:59:59. Leading zeroes are allowed (e.g. "06:03") and correctly interpreted
as base-10.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-monthdays\fP \fIday\fP[\fB,\fP\fIday\fP...]
.IP
Only match on the given days of the month. Possible values are \fB1\fP
to \fB31\fP. Note that specifying \fB31\fP will of course not match
on months which do not have a 31st day; the same goes for 28- or 29-day
February.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-weekdays\fP \fIday\fP[\fB,\fP\fIday\fP...]
.IP
Only match on the given weekdays. Possible values are \fBMon\fP, \fBTue\fP,
\fBWed\fP, \fBThu\fP, \fBFri\fP, \fBSat\fP, \fBSun\fP, or values from \fB1\fP
to \fB7\fP, respectively. You may also use two-character variants (\fBMo\fP,
\fBTu\fP, etc.).
.TP
\fB\-\-utc\fP
.IP
Interpret the times given for \fB\-\-datestart\fP, \fB\-\-datestop\fP,
\fB\-\-timestart\fP and \fB\-\-timestop\fP to be UTC.
.TP
\fB\-\-localtz\fP
.IP
Interpret the times given for \fB\-\-datestart\fP, \fB\-\-datestop\fP,
\fB\-\-timestart\fP and \fB\-\-timestop\fP to be local kernel time. (Default)
.PP
EXAMPLES. To match on weekends, use:
.IP
\-m time \-\-weekdays Sa,Su
.PP
Or, to match (once) on a national holiday block:
.IP
\-m time \-\-datestart 2007\-12\-24 \-\-datestop 2007\-12\-27
.PP
Since the stop time is actually inclusive, you would need the following stop
time to not match the first second of the new day:
.IP
\-m time \-\-datestart 2007\-01\-01T17:00 \-\-datestop 2007\-01\-01T23:59:59
.PP
During lunch hour:
.IP
\-m time \-\-timestart 12:30 \-\-timestop 13:30
.PP
The fourth Friday in the month:
.IP
\-m time \-\-weekdays Fr \-\-monthdays 22,23,24,25,26,27,28
.PP
(Note that this exploits a certain mathematical property. It is not possible to
say "fourth Thursday OR fourth Friday" in one rule. It is possible with
multiple rules, though.)
.SS tos
This module matches the 8-bit Type of Service field in the IPv4 header (i.e.
including the "Precedence" bits) or the (also 8-bit) Priority field in the IPv6
header.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-tos\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Matches packets with the given TOS mark value. If a mask is specified, it is
logically ANDed with the TOS mark before the comparison.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-tos\fP \fIsymbol\fP
You can specify a symbolic name when using the tos match for IPv4. The list of
recognized TOS names can be obtained by calling iptables with \fB\-m tos \-h\fP.
Note that this implies a mask of 0x3F, i.e. all but the ECN bits.
.SS u32
U32 tests whether quantities of up to 4 bytes extracted from a packet have
specified values. The specification of what to extract is general enough to
find data at given offsets from tcp headers or payloads.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-u32\fP \fItests\fP
The argument amounts to a program in a small language described below.
.IP
tests := location "=" value | tests "&&" location "=" value
.IP
value := range | value "," range
.IP
range := number | number ":" number
.PP
a single number, \fIn\fP, is interpreted the same as \fIn:n\fP. \fIn:m\fP is
interpreted as the range of numbers \fB>=n\fP and \fB<=m\fP.
.IP "" 4
location := number | location operator number
.IP "" 4
operator := "&" | "<<" | ">>" | "@"
.PP
The operators \fB&\fP, \fB<<\fP, \fB>>\fP and \fB&&\fP mean the same as in C.
The \fB=\fP is really a set membership operator and the value syntax describes
a set. The \fB@\fP operator is what allows moving to the next header and is
described further below.
.PP
There are currently some artificial implementation limits on the size of the
tests:
.IP "    *"
no more than 10 of "\fB=\fP" (and 9 "\fB&&\fP"s) in the u32 argument
.IP "    *"
no more than 10 ranges (and 9 commas) per value
.IP "    *"
no more than 10 numbers (and 9 operators) per location
.PP
To describe the meaning of location, imagine the following machine that
interprets it. There are three registers:
.IP
A is of type \fBchar *\fP, initially the address of the IP header
.IP
B and C are unsigned 32 bit integers, initially zero
.PP
The instructions are:
.IP
number B = number;
.IP
C = (*(A+B)<<24) + (*(A+B+1)<<16) + (*(A+B+2)<<8) + *(A+B+3)
.IP
&number C = C & number
.IP
<< number C = C << number
.IP
>> number C = C >> number
.IP
@number A = A + C; then do the instruction number
.PP
Any access of memory outside [skb\->data,skb\->end] causes the match to fail.
Otherwise the result of the computation is the final value of C.
.PP
Whitespace is allowed but not required in the tests. However, the characters
that do occur there are likely to require shell quoting, so it is a good idea
to enclose the arguments in quotes.
.PP
Example:
.IP
match IP packets with total length >= 256
.IP
The IP header contains a total length field in bytes 2-3.
.IP
\-\-u32 "\fB0 & 0xFFFF = 0x100:0xFFFF\fP"
.IP
read bytes 0-3
.IP
AND that with 0xFFFF (giving bytes 2-3), and test whether that is in the range
[0x100:0xFFFF]
.PP
Example: (more realistic, hence more complicated)
.IP
match ICMP packets with icmp type 0
.IP
First test that it is an ICMP packet, true iff byte 9 (protocol) = 1
.IP
\-\-u32 "\fB6 & 0xFF = 1 &&\fP ...
.IP
read bytes 6-9, use \fB&\fP to throw away bytes 6-8 and compare the result to
1. Next test that it is not a fragment. (If so, it might be part of such a
packet but we cannot always tell.) N.B.: This test is generally needed if you
want to match anything beyond the IP header. The last 6 bits of byte 6 and all
of byte 7 are 0 iff this is a complete packet (not a fragment). Alternatively,
you can allow first fragments by only testing the last 5 bits of byte 6.
.IP
 ... \fB4 & 0x3FFF = 0 &&\fP ...
.IP
Last test: the first byte past the IP header (the type) is 0. This is where we
have to use the @syntax. The length of the IP header (IHL) in 32 bit words is
stored in the right half of byte 0 of the IP header itself.
.IP
 ... \fB0 >> 22 & 0x3C @ 0 >> 24 = 0\fP"
.IP
The first 0 means read bytes 0-3, \fB>>22\fP means shift that 22 bits to the
right. Shifting 24 bits would give the first byte, so only 22 bits is four
times that plus a few more bits. \fB&3C\fP then eliminates the two extra bits
on the right and the first four bits of the first byte. For instance, if IHL=5,
then the IP header is 20 (4 x 5) bytes long. In this case, bytes 0-1 are (in
binary) xxxx0101 yyzzzzzz, \fB>>22\fP gives the 10 bit value xxxx0101yy and
\fB&3C\fP gives 010100. \fB@\fP means to use this number as a new offset into
the packet, and read four bytes starting from there. This is the first 4 bytes
of the ICMP payload, of which byte 0 is the ICMP type. Therefore, we simply
shift the value 24 to the right to throw out all but the first byte and compare
the result with 0.
.PP
Example:
.IP
TCP payload bytes 8-12 is any of 1, 2, 5 or 8
.IP
First we test that the packet is a tcp packet (similar to ICMP).
.IP
\-\-u32 "\fB6 & 0xFF = 6 &&\fP ...
.IP
Next, test that it is not a fragment (same as above).
.IP
 ... \fB0 >> 22 & 0x3C @ 12 >> 26 & 0x3C @ 8 = 1,2,5,8\fP"
.IP
\fB0>>22&3C\fP as above computes the number of bytes in the IP header. \fB@\fP
makes this the new offset into the packet, which is the start of the TCP
header. The length of the TCP header (again in 32 bit words) is the left half
of byte 12 of the TCP header. The \fB12>>26&3C\fP computes this length in bytes
(similar to the IP header before). "@" makes this the new offset, which is the
start of the TCP payload. Finally, 8 reads bytes 8-12 of the payload and
\fB=\fP checks whether the result is any of 1, 2, 5 or 8.
.SS udp
These extensions can be used if `\-\-protocol udp' is specified. It
provides the following options:
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-source\-port\fP,\fB\-\-sport\fP \fIport\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP]
Source port or port range specification.
See the description of the
\fB\-\-source\-port\fP
option of the TCP extension for details.
.TP
[\fB!\fP] \fB\-\-destination\-port\fP,\fB\-\-dport\fP \fIport\fP[\fB:\fP\fIport\fP]
Destination port or port range specification.
See the description of the
\fB\-\-destination\-port\fP
option of the TCP extension for details.
.SH TARGET EXTENSIONS
ip6tables can use extended target modules: the following are included
in the standard distribution.
.\" @TARGET@
.SS CHECKSUM
This target allows to selectively work around broken/old applications.
It can only be used in the mangle table.
.TP
\fB\-\-checksum\-fill\fP
Compute and fill in the checksum in a packet that lacks a checksum.
This is particularly useful, if you need to work around old applications
such as dhcp clients, that do not work well with checksum offloads,
but don't want to disable checksum offload in your device.
.SS CLASSIFY
This module allows you to set the skb\->priority value (and thus classify the packet into a specific CBQ class).
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-class\fP \fImajor\fP\fB:\fP\fIminor\fP
Set the major and minor class value. The values are always interpreted as
hexadecimal even if no 0x prefix is given.
.SS CONNMARK
This module sets the netfilter mark value associated with a connection. The
mark is 32 bits wide.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Zero out the bits given by \fImask\fP and XOR \fIvalue\fP into the ctmark.
.TP
\fB\-\-save\-mark\fP [\fB\-\-nfmask\fP \fInfmask\fP] [\fB\-\-ctmask\fP \fIctmask\fP]
Copy the packet mark (nfmark) to the connection mark (ctmark) using the given
masks. The new nfmark value is determined as follows:
.IP
ctmark = (ctmark & ~ctmask) ^ (nfmark & nfmask)
.IP
i.e. \fIctmask\fP defines what bits to clear and \fInfmask\fP what bits of the
nfmark to XOR into the ctmark. \fIctmask\fP and \fInfmask\fP default to
0xFFFFFFFF.
.TP
\fB\-\-restore\-mark\fP [\fB\-\-nfmask\fP \fInfmask\fP] [\fB\-\-ctmask\fP \fIctmask\fP]
Copy the connection mark (ctmark) to the packet mark (nfmark) using the given
masks. The new ctmark value is determined as follows:
.IP
nfmark = (nfmark & ~\fInfmask\fP) ^ (ctmark & \fIctmask\fP);
.IP
i.e. \fInfmask\fP defines what bits to clear and \fIctmask\fP what bits of the
ctmark to XOR into the nfmark. \fIctmask\fP and \fInfmask\fP default to
0xFFFFFFFF.
.IP
\fB\-\-restore\-mark\fP is only valid in the \fBmangle\fP table.
.PP
The following mnemonics are available for \fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP:
.TP
\fB\-\-and\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary AND the ctmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark
0/\fP\fIinvbits\fP, where \fIinvbits\fP is the binary negation of \fIbits\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-or\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary OR the ctmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/\fP\fIbits\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-xor\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary XOR the ctmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/0\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-mark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Set the connection mark. If a mask is specified then only those bits set in the
mask are modified.
.TP
\fB\-\-save\-mark\fP [\fB\-\-mask\fP \fImask\fP]
Copy the nfmark to the ctmark. If a mask is specified, only those bits are
copied.
.TP
\fB\-\-restore\-mark\fP [\fB\-\-mask\fP \fImask\fP]
Copy the ctmark to the nfmark. If a mask is specified, only those bits are
copied. This is only valid in the \fBmangle\fP table.
.SS CONNSECMARK
This module copies security markings from packets to connections
(if unlabeled), and from connections back to packets (also only
if unlabeled).  Typically used in conjunction with SECMARK, it is
only valid in the
.B mangle
table.
.TP
\fB\-\-save\fP
If the packet has a security marking, copy it to the connection
if the connection is not marked.
.TP
\fB\-\-restore\fP
If the packet does not have a security marking, and the connection
does, copy the security marking from the connection to the packet.

.SS CT
The CT target allows to set parameters for a packet or its associated
connection. The target attaches a "template" connection tracking entry to
the packet, which is then used by the conntrack core when initializing
a new ct entry. This target is thus only valid in the "raw" table.
.TP
\fB\-\-notrack\fP
Disables connection tracking for this packet.
.TP
\fB\-\-helper\fP \fIname\fP
Use the helper identified by \fIname\fP for the connection. This is more
flexible than loading the conntrack helper modules with preset ports.
.TP
\fB\-\-ctevents\fP \fIevent\fP[\fB,\fP...]
Only generate the specified conntrack events for this connection. Possible
event types are: \fBnew\fP, \fBrelated\fP, \fBdestroy\fP, \fBreply\fP,
\fBassured\fP, \fBprotoinfo\fP, \fBhelper\fP, \fBmark\fP (this refers to
the ctmark, not nfmark), \fBnatseqinfo\fP, \fBsecmark\fP (ctsecmark).
.TP
\fB\-\-expevents\fP \fIevent\fP[\fB,\fP...]
Only generate the specified expectation events for this connection.
Possible event types are: \fBnew\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-zone\fP \fIid\fP
Assign this packet to zone \fIid\fP and only have lookups done in that zone.
By default, packets have zone 0.
.SS DSCP
This target allows to alter the value of the DSCP bits within the TOS
header of the IPv4 packet.  As this manipulates a packet, it can only
be used in the mangle table.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-dscp\fP \fIvalue\fP
Set the DSCP field to a numerical value (can be decimal or hex)
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-dscp\-class\fP \fIclass\fP
Set the DSCP field to a DiffServ class.
.SS HL
This is used to modify the Hop Limit field in IPv6 header. The Hop Limit field
is similar to what is known as TTL value in IPv4.  Setting or incrementing the
Hop Limit field can potentially be very dangerous, so it should be avoided at
any cost. This target is only valid in
.B mangle
table.
.PP
.B Don't ever set or increment the value on packets that leave your local network!
.TP
\fB\-\-hl\-set\fP \fIvalue\fP
Set the Hop Limit to `value'.
.TP
\fB\-\-hl\-dec\fP \fIvalue\fP
Decrement the Hop Limit `value' times.
.TP
\fB\-\-hl\-inc\fP \fIvalue\fP
Increment the Hop Limit `value' times.
.SS IDLETIMER
This target can be used to identify when interfaces have been idle for a
certain period of time.  Timers are identified by labels and are created when
a rule is set with a new label.  The rules also take a timeout value (in
seconds) as an option.  If more than one rule uses the same timer label, the
timer will be restarted whenever any of the rules get a hit.  One entry for
each timer is created in sysfs.  This attribute contains the timer remaining
for the timer to expire.  The attributes are located under the xt_idletimer
class:
.PP
/sys/class/xt_idletimer/timers/<label>
.PP
When the timer expires, the target module sends a sysfs notification to the
userspace, which can then decide what to do (eg. disconnect to save power).
.TP
\fB\-\-timeout\fP \fIamount\fP
This is the time in seconds that will trigger the notification.
.TP
\fB\-\-label\fP \fIstring\fP
This is a unique identifier for the timer.  The maximum length for the
label string is 27 characters.
.SS LOG
Turn on kernel logging of matching packets.  When this option is set
for a rule, the Linux kernel will print some information on all
matching packets (like most IPv6 IPv6-header fields) via the kernel log
(where it can be read with
.I dmesg
or 
.IR syslogd (8)).
This is a "non-terminating target", i.e. rule traversal continues at
the next rule.  So if you want to LOG the packets you refuse, use two
separate rules with the same matching criteria, first using target LOG
then DROP (or REJECT).
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-level\fP \fIlevel\fP
Level of logging (numeric or see \fIsyslog.conf\fP(5)).
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP
Prefix log messages with the specified prefix; up to 29 letters long,
and useful for distinguishing messages in the logs.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-tcp\-sequence\fP
Log TCP sequence numbers. This is a security risk if the log is
readable by users.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-tcp\-options\fP
Log options from the TCP packet header.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-ip\-options\fP
Log options from the IPv6 packet header.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-uid\fP
Log the userid of the process which generated the packet.
.SS MARK
This target is used to set the Netfilter mark value associated with the packet.
It can, for example, be used in conjunction with routing based on fwmark (needs
iproute2). If you plan on doing so, note that the mark needs to be set in the
PREROUTING chain of the mangle table to affect routing.
The mark field is 32 bits wide.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Zeroes out the bits given by \fImask\fP and XORs \fIvalue\fP into the packet
mark ("nfmark"). If \fImask\fP is omitted, 0xFFFFFFFF is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-mark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Zeroes out the bits given by \fImask\fP and ORs \fIvalue\fP into the packet
mark. If \fImask\fP is omitted, 0xFFFFFFFF is assumed.
.PP
The following mnemonics are available:
.TP
\fB\-\-and\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary AND the nfmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark
0/\fP\fIinvbits\fP, where \fIinvbits\fP is the binary negation of \fIbits\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-or\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary OR the nfmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/\fP\fIbits\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-xor\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary XOR the nfmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/0\fP.)
.SS NFLOG
This target provides logging of matching packets. When this target is
set for a rule, the Linux kernel will pass the packet to the loaded
logging backend to log the packet. This is usually used in combination
with nfnetlink_log as logging backend, which will multicast the packet
through a
.IR netlink
socket to the specified multicast group. One or more userspace processes
may subscribe to the group to receive the packets. Like LOG, this is a
non-terminating target, i.e. rule traversal continues at the next rule.
.TP
\fB\-\-nflog\-group\fP \fInlgroup\fP
The netlink group (1 \- 2^32\-1) to which packets are (only applicable for
nfnetlink_log). The default value is 0.
.TP
\fB\-\-nflog\-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP
A prefix string to include in the log message, up to 64 characters
long, useful for distinguishing messages in the logs.
.TP
\fB\-\-nflog\-range\fP \fIsize\fP
The number of bytes to be copied to userspace (only applicable for
nfnetlink_log). nfnetlink_log instances may specify their own
range, this option overrides it.
.TP
\fB\-\-nflog\-threshold\fP \fIsize\fP
Number of packets to queue inside the kernel before sending them
to userspace (only applicable for nfnetlink_log). Higher values
result in less overhead per packet, but increase delay until the
packets reach userspace. The default value is 1.
.BR
.SS NFQUEUE
This target is an extension of the QUEUE target. As opposed to QUEUE, it allows
you to put a packet into any specific queue, identified by its 16-bit queue
number.
It can only be used with Kernel versions 2.6.14 or later, since it requires
the
.B
nfnetlink_queue
kernel support. The \fBqueue-balance\fP option was added in Linux 2.6.31.
.TP
\fB\-\-queue\-num\fP \fIvalue\fP
This specifies the QUEUE number to use. Valid queue numbers are 0 to 65535. The default value is 0.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-queue\-balance\fP \fIvalue\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
This specifies a range of queues to use. Packets are then balanced across the given queues.
This is useful for multicore systems: start multiple instances of the userspace program on
queues x, x+1, .. x+n and use "\-\-queue\-balance \fIx\fP\fB:\fP\fIx+n\fP".
Packets belonging to the same connection are put into the same nfqueue.
.SS NOTRACK
This target disables connection tracking for all packets matching that rule.
.PP
It can only be used in the
.B raw
table.
.SS RATEEST
The RATEEST target collects statistics, performs rate estimation calculation
and saves the results for later evaluation using the \fBrateest\fP match.
.TP
\fB\-\-rateest\-name\fP \fIname\fP
Count matched packets into the pool referred to by \fIname\fP, which is freely
choosable.
.TP
\fB\-\-rateest\-interval\fP \fIamount\fP{\fBs\fP|\fBms\fP|\fBus\fP}
Rate measurement interval, in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds.
.TP
\fB\-\-rateest\-ewmalog\fP \fIvalue\fP
Rate measurement averaging time constant.
.SS REJECT
This is used to send back an error packet in response to the matched
packet: otherwise it is equivalent to 
.B DROP
so it is a terminating TARGET, ending rule traversal.
This target is only valid in the
.BR INPUT ,
.B FORWARD
and
.B OUTPUT
chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those
chains.  The following option controls the nature of the error packet
returned:
.TP
\fB\-\-reject\-with\fP \fItype\fP
The type given can be
\fBicmp6\-no\-route\fP,
\fBno\-route\fP,
\fBicmp6\-adm\-prohibited\fP,
\fBadm\-prohibited\fP,
\fBicmp6\-addr\-unreachable\fP,
\fBaddr\-unreach\fP,
\fBicmp6\-port\-unreachable\fP or
\fBport\-unreach\fP
which return the appropriate ICMPv6 error message (\fBport\-unreach\fP is
the default). Finally, the option
\fBtcp\-reset\fP
can be used on rules which only match the TCP protocol: this causes a
TCP RST packet to be sent back.  This is mainly useful for blocking 
.I ident
(113/tcp) probes which frequently occur when sending mail to broken mail
hosts (which won't accept your mail otherwise).
\fBtcp\-reset\fP
can only be used with kernel versions 2.6.14 or later.
.SS SECMARK
This is used to set the security mark value associated with the
packet for use by security subsystems such as SELinux.  It is only
valid in the
.B mangle
table. The mark is 32 bits wide.
.TP
\fB\-\-selctx\fP \fIsecurity_context\fP
.SS SET
This modules adds and/or deletes entries from IP sets which can be defined 
by ipset(8).
.TP
\fB\-\-add\-set\fP \fIsetname\fP \fIflag\fP[\fB,\fP\fIflag\fP...]
add the address(es)/port(s) of the packet to the sets
.TP
\fB\-\-del\-set\fP \fIsetname\fP \fIflag\fP[\fB,\fP\fIflag\fP...]
delete the address(es)/port(s) of the packet from the sets
.IP
where flags are
.BR "src"
and/or
.BR "dst"
specifications and there can be no more than six of them.
.PP
Use of -j SET requires that ipset kernel support is provided. As standard
kernels do not ship this currently, the ipset or Xtables-addons package needs
to be installed.
.SS TCPMSS
This target allows to alter the MSS value of TCP SYN packets, to control
the maximum size for that connection (usually limiting it to your
outgoing interface's MTU minus 40 for IPv4 or 60 for IPv6, respectively).
Of course, it can only be used
in conjunction with
\fB\-p tcp\fP.
.PP
This target is used to overcome criminally braindead ISPs or servers
which block "ICMP Fragmentation Needed" or "ICMPv6 Packet Too Big"
packets.  The symptoms of this
problem are that everything works fine from your Linux
firewall/router, but machines behind it can never exchange large
packets:
.PD 0
.RS 0.1i
.TP 0.3i
1)
Web browsers connect, then hang with no data received.
.TP
2)
Small mail works fine, but large emails hang.
.TP
3)
ssh works fine, but scp hangs after initial handshaking.
.RE
.PD
Workaround: activate this option and add a rule to your firewall
configuration like:
.IP
 iptables \-t mangle \-A FORWARD \-p tcp \-\-tcp\-flags SYN,RST SYN
             \-j TCPMSS \-\-clamp\-mss\-to\-pmtu
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-mss\fP \fIvalue\fP
Explicitly sets MSS option to specified value. If the MSS of the packet is
already lower than \fIvalue\fP, it will \fBnot\fP be increased (from Linux
2.6.25 onwards) to avoid more problems with hosts relying on a proper MSS.
.TP
\fB\-\-clamp\-mss\-to\-pmtu\fP
Automatically clamp MSS value to (path_MTU \- 40 for IPv4; \-60 for IPv6).
This may not function as desired where asymmetric routes with differing
path MTU exist \(em the kernel uses the path MTU which it would use to send
packets from itself to the source and destination IP addresses. Prior to
Linux 2.6.25, only the path MTU to the destination IP address was
considered by this option; subsequent kernels also consider the path MTU
to the source IP address.
.PP
These options are mutually exclusive.
.SS TCPOPTSTRIP
This target will strip TCP options off a TCP packet. (It will actually replace
them by NO-OPs.) As such, you will need to add the \fB\-p tcp\fP parameters.
.TP
\fB\-\-strip\-options\fP \fIoption\fP[\fB,\fP\fIoption\fP...]
Strip the given option(s). The options may be specified by TCP option number or
by symbolic name. The list of recognized options can be obtained by calling
iptables with \fB\-j TCPOPTSTRIP \-h\fP.
.SS TEE
The \fBTEE\fP target will clone a packet and redirect this clone to another
machine on the \fBlocal\fP network segment. In other words, the nexthop
must be the target, or you will have to configure the nexthop to forward it
further if so desired.
.TP
\fB\-\-gateway\fP \fIipaddr\fP
Send the cloned packet to the host reachable at the given IP address.
Use of 0.0.0.0 (for IPv4 packets) or :: (IPv6) is invalid.
.PP
To forward all incoming traffic on eth0 to an Network Layer logging box:
.PP
\-t mangle \-A PREROUTING \-i eth0 \-j TEE \-\-gateway 2001:db8::1
.SS TOS
This module sets the Type of Service field in the IPv4 header (including the
"precedence" bits) or the Priority field in the IPv6 header. Note that TOS
shares the same bits as DSCP and ECN. The TOS target is only valid in the
\fBmangle\fP table.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-tos\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Zeroes out the bits given by \fImask\fP and XORs \fIvalue\fP into the
TOS/Priority field. If \fImask\fP is omitted, 0xFF is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-tos\fP \fIsymbol\fP
You can specify a symbolic name when using the TOS target for IPv4. It implies
a mask of 0xFF. The list of recognized TOS names can be obtained by calling
iptables with \fB\-j TOS \-h\fP.
.PP
The following mnemonics are available:
.TP
\fB\-\-and\-tos\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary AND the TOS value with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-tos
0/\fP\fIinvbits\fP, where \fIinvbits\fP is the binary negation of \fIbits\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-or\-tos\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary OR the TOS value with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-tos\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/\fP\fIbits\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-xor\-tos\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary XOR the TOS value with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-tos\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/0\fP.)
.SS TRACE
This target marks packes so that the kernel will log every rule which match 
the packets as those traverse the tables, chains, rules. (The ipt_LOG or
ip6t_LOG module 
is required for the logging.) The packets are logged with the string prefix: 
"TRACE: tablename:chainname:type:rulenum " where type can be "rule" for 
plain rule, "return" for implicit rule at the end of a user defined chain 
and "policy" for the policy of the built in chains. 
.br
It can only be used in the
.BR raw
table.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Various error messages are printed to standard error.  The exit code
is 0 for correct functioning.  Errors which appear to be caused by
invalid or abused command line parameters cause an exit code of 2, and
other errors cause an exit code of 1.
.SH BUGS
Bugs?  What's this? ;-)
Well... the counters are not reliable on sparc64.
.SH COMPATIBILITY WITH IPCHAINS
This \fBip6tables\fP
is very similar to ipchains by Rusty Russell.  The main difference is
that the chains \fBINPUT\fP and \fBOUTPUT\fP
are only traversed for packets coming into the local host and
originating from the local host respectively.  Hence every packet only
passes through one of the three chains (except loopback traffic, which
involves both INPUT and OUTPUT chains); previously a forwarded packet
would pass through all three.
.PP
The other main difference is that \fB\-i\fP refers to the input interface;
\fB\-o\fP refers to the output interface, and both are available for packets
entering the \fBFORWARD\fP chain.
There are several other changes in ip6tables.
