Some notes for the Tru64 Unix 5.x port
======================================

1. Compiling
------------

You need at least net-snmp version 5.1.3 to compile on Tru64 Unix 5.x.
Version 5.2.2 or later is recommended, see below.

The following procedure has been proven to successfully compile net-snmp 
5.1.3.dev on Tru64 Unix 5.1B (Alpha EV5.6) using the Compaq C 6.5 compiler:

	CC=cc ./configure --with-out-mib-modules="mibII/tcpTable mibII/udpTable"
	make
	su -
	make install

A recent GNU C compiler (gcc) will probably work, too.

Starting with version 5.2.2, net-snmp will build with the default options
(just "./configure" will do).

Please note that the "host" module doesn't compile on Tru64, so you *can't*
configure with "--with-mib-modules=host".

2. Testing
----------

"make test" reports a number of problems on Tru64 Unix. It is yet to be checked
whether these are problems in the test scripts or the toolkit.


3. Feedback
-----------

Please also see README and PORTING.

If you have questions, additional insights or (even better) patches regarding
net-snmp on Tru64 Unix, please refer to the net-snmp mailing lists (see 
http://www.net-snmp.org/lists).
