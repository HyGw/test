This is what I had to do to get it to work for me. Your mileage may vary.
If this doesn't work for you, or you have fixes for any problems listed,
please post to <net-snmp-coders@lists.sourceforge.net>. Thanks!

  - ALL

    - Test 44 (Perl AgentX Subagent) fails.

      - There are 2 issues here. One is the perl can't find the
        net-snmp shared libraries, because they aren't installed yet.
        Setting DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH helps here, but one link error
        remains:

           /usr/bin/perl Undefined symbols: _boot_DynaLoader

        Unless you need a perl based AgentX subagent, you can ignore
        this error.

     - nlist doesn't support icmpstat

       - disable the icmp module during configure by specifying
         "--with-out-mib-modules=mibII/icmp", or at startup by adding
         "-I -icmp" to the snmpd command line.


  - 10.3.x and earlier

     - Some older versions of Apple's cpp doesn't like configure. 

        - run 'gcc_select' to see what version you are using, and
          'gcc_select -l' to list available versions. I've had success with
          3.3, selected by running (as root) 'gcc_select 3.3'. (Note: this was
          on Panther, 10.3.2)

     - Some older versions of net-snmp as installed by Apple contains
       bad flags in net-snmp-config.

       - build your own version, and install over Apple's version. The
         configure flags you need for the same configuration:

         configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man
                   --infodir=/usr/share/info --with-libwrap --with-defaults
                   --prefix=/usr --with-persistent-directory=/var/db/ucd-snmp
                   --with-mib-modules=host
