.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBntfs-3g\fR is an NTFS driver, which can create, remove, rename, move
files, directories, hard links, and streams; it can read and write files,
including streams, sparse files and transparently compressed files; it can
handle special files like symbolic links, devices, and FIFOs; moreover it
provides standard management of file ownership and permissions, including
POSIX ACLs.
.PP
It comes in two variants \fBntfs-3g\fR and \fBlowntfs-3g\fR with
a few differences mentioned below in relevant options descriptions.
.PP
The \fIvolume\fR to be mounted can be either a block device or 
an image file.
.SS Access Handling and Security
By default, files and directories are owned by the effective 
user and group of the mounting process and everybody has
full read, write, execution and directory browsing permissions.
You can also assign permissions to a single user by using the
.B uid
and/or the
.B gid 
options together with the 
.B umask,
or
.B fmask
and
.B dmask
options.
.PP
Doing so, Windows users have full access to the files created by 
.B ntfs-3g.
.PP
But, by defining a Windows-to-Linux user mapping in the file
\fB.NTFS-3G/UserMapping\fP, you can benefit from the full ownership and
permissions features as defined by Posix and those ownership and
permissions will be applied to Windows users and conversely.
.PP
If 
.B ntfs-3g 
is set setuid-root then non-root users will 
be also able to mount volumes.
.SS Windows Filename Compatibility
NTFS supports several filename namespaces: DOS, Win32 and POSIX. While the
\fBntfs-3g\fR driver handles all of them, it always creates new files in the 
POSIX namespace for maximum portability and interoperability reasons. 
This means that filenames are case sensitive and all characters are
allowed except '/' and '\\0'. This is perfectly legal on Windows, though
some application may get confused. If you find so then please report it
to the developer of the relevant Windows software.
.SS Alternate Data Streams (ADS)
NTFS stores all data in streams. Every file has exactly one unnamed
data stream and can have many named data streams.  The size of a file is the
size of its unnamed data stream.  By default, \fBntfs-3g\fR will only read
the unnamed data stream.
.PP
By using the options "streams_interface=windows", with the ntfs-3g driver
(not possible with lowntfs-3g), you will be able to read any named data
streams, simply by specifying the stream's name after a colon.
For example:
.RS
.sp
cat some.mp3:artist
.sp
.RE
Named data streams act like normal files, so you can read from them, write to
them and even delete them (using rm).  You can list all the named data streams
a file has by getting the "ntfs.streams.list" extended attribute.
.SH OPTIONS
Below is a summary of the options that \fBntfs-3g\fR accepts.
.TP
\fBuid=\fP\fIvalue\fP and \fBgid=\fP\fIvalue\fP
Set the owner and the group of files and directories. The values are numerical.
The defaults are the uid and gid of the current process.
.TP
.BI umask= value
Set the  bitmask of the file and directory permissions that are not
present. The value is given in octal. The default value is 0 which
means full access to everybody.
.TP
.BI fmask= value
Set the  bitmask of the file permissions that are not present. 
The value is given in octal. The default value is 0 which
means full access to everybody.
.TP
.BI dmask= value
Set the  bitmask of the directory permissions that are not
present. The value is given in octal. The default value is 0 which
means full access to everybody.
.TP
.BI usermapping= file-name
Use file \fIfile-name\fP as the user mapping file instead of the default
\fB.NTFS-3G/UserMapping\fP. If \fIfile-name\fP defines a full path, the
file must be located on a partition previously mounted. If it defines a
relative path, it is interpreted relative to the root of NTFS partition
being mounted.
.P
.RS
When a user mapping file is defined, the options \fBuid=\fP, \fBgid=\fP,
\fBumask=\fP, \fBfmask=\fP, \fBdmask=\fP and \fBdsilent=\fP are ignored.
.RE
.TP
.B default_permissions
Use standard access control. This option requires either a user mapping
file to be present, or the options \fIuid=\fP and \fIgid=\fP of a user
to be defined. This option is set by default when a user mapping file
or an ownership related option is present.
.TP
.B inherit
When creating a new file, set its initial ownership and protections
according to inheritance rules defined in parent directory. These rules
deviate from Posix specifications, but yield a better Windows
compatibility. A valid user mapping file is required for this option
to be effective.
.TP
.B ro
Mount filesystem read\-only. Useful if Windows is hibernated or the
NTFS journal file is unclean.
.TP
.BI locale= value
This option can be useful when wanting a language specific locale environment.
It is however discouraged as it leads to files with untranslatable chars
to not be visible. Please see more information about this topic at
http://ntfs-3g.org/support.html#locale
.TP
.B force
Force the mounting even if the NTFS logfile is unclean. The logfile 
will be unconditionally cleared. Use this option with caution and for 
your own responsibility.
.TP
.B remove_hiberfile
Unlike in case of read-only mount, the read-write mount is denied if 
the NTFS volume is hibernated. One needs either to resume Windows and
shutdown it properly, or use this option which will remove the Windows
hibernation file. Please note, this means that the saved Windows 
session will be completely lost. Use this option for your own 
responsibility.
.TP
.B atime, noatime, relatime
The 
.B atime 
option updates inode access time for each access.

The 
.B noatime 
option disables inode access time updates which can speed up
file operations and prevent sleeping (notebook) disks spinning 
up too often thus saving energy and disk lifetime.

The
.B relatime 
option is very similar to 
.B noatime. 
It updates inode access times relative to modify or change time. 
The access time is only updated if the previous access time was earlier 
than the current modify or change time. Unlike
.B noatime
this option doesn't break applications that need to know 
if a file has been read since the last time it was modified.
This is the default behaviour.
.TP
.B show_sys_files
Show the system files in directory listings. 
Otherwise the default behaviour is to hide the system files.
Please note that even when this option is specified, "$MFT"
may not be visible due to a glibc bug.
Furthermore, irrespectively of show_sys_files, all
files are accessible by name, for example you can always do
"ls \-l '$UpCase'".
.TP
.B allow_other
This option overrides the security measure restricting file access
to the user mounting the filesystem. This option is only
allowed to root, but this restriction can be overridden by
the 'user_allow_other' option in the /etc/fuse.conf file.
.TP
.BI max_read= value
With this option the maximum size of read operations can be set.
The default is infinite.  Note that the size of read requests is
limited anyway to 32 pages (which is 128kbyte on i386).
.TP
.B silent
Do nothing on chmod and chown operations, but do not return error
when the user mapping file required by these operations is not defined.
This option is on by default.
.TP
.B no_def_opts
By default ntfs-3g acts as if "silent" were set, and
this option cancel this default behavior.
.TP
.BI streams_interface= value
This option controls how the user can access Alternate Data Streams (ADS)
or in other words, named data streams. It can be set
to, one of \fBnone\fR, \fBwindows\fR or \fBxattr\fR. If the option is set to
\fBnone\fR, the user will have no access to the named data streams.  If it's set
to \fBwindows\fR, then the user can access them just like in Windows (eg. cat
file:stream). If it's set to \fBxattr\fR, then the named data streams are
mapped to xattrs and user can manipulate them using \fB{get,set}fattr\fR
utilities. The default is \fBxattr\fR.
.TP
.B user_xattr
Same as \fBstreams_interface=\fP\fIxattr\fP.
.TP
.B efs_raw
This option should only be used in backup or restore situation.
It changes the apparent size of files and the behavior of read and
write operation so that encrypted files can be saved and restored
without being decrypted. The \fBuser.ntfs.efsinfo\fP extended attribute
has also to be saved and restored for the file to be decrypted.
.TP
.B debug
Makes ntfs-3g to not detach from terminal and print a lot of debug output from
libntfs-3g and FUSE.
.TP
.B no_detach
Same as above but with less debug output.
.SH USER MAPPING
NTFS uses specific ids to record the ownership of files instead of
the \fBuid\fP and \fBgid\fP used by Linux. As a consequence a mapping
between the ids has to be defined for ownerships to be recorded into
NTFS and recognized.
.P
By default this mapping is fetched from the file \fB.NTFS-3G/UserMapping\fP
located in the NTFS partition. The option \fBusermapping=\fP may be used
to define another location.
.P
Each line in the user mapping file defines a mapping. It is organized
in three fields separated by colons. The first field identifies a \fBuid\fP,
the second field identifies a \fBgid\fP and the third one identifies the
corresponding NTFS id, known as a \fBSID\fP. The \fBuid\fP and the \fBgid\fP
are optional and defining both of them for the same \fBSID\fP is not
recommended.
.P
If no interoperation with Windows is needed, a single default mapping
with no uid and gid can be used. Just copy the example below and replace
the 9 and 10-digit numbers by any number not greater than 4294967295.
.RS
.sp
.B ::S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-10000
.sp
.RE
If interoperation with Windows is needed, the mapping has to be defined
for each user and group known in both system, and the \fBSID\fPs used
by Windows has to be collected. This will lead to a user mapping file
like :
.RS
.sp
.B john::S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-1008
.B mary::S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-1009

.B ::S-1-5-21-3141592653-589793238-462643383-10000
.sp
.RE
.P
The utility \fBntfs-3g.usermap\fP may be used to create the user mapping file.

.SH EXIT CODES
To facilitate the use of the
.B ntfs-3g
driver in scripts, an exit code is returned to give an indication of the 
mountability status of a volume. Value 0 means success, and all other
ones mean an error. The unique error codes are documented in the
.BR ntfs-3g.probe (8)
manual page.
