	The key for the IEEE 802.1Q to perform the above functions is in its tags. 
	802.1Q-compliant switch ports can be configured to transmit tagged or 
	untagged frames. A tag field containing VLAN (and/or 802.1p priority) 
	
	
	information can be inserted into an Ethernet frame. If a port has an 
	802.1Q-compliant device attached (such as another switch), these tagged 
	frames can carry VLAN membership information between switches, thus letting
	 
	
	a VLAN span multiple switches. However, it is important to ensure ports with 
	non-802.1Q-compliant devices attached are configured to transmit untagged 
	frames. Many NICs for PCs and printers are not 802.1Q-compliant. If they
	 
	
	receive a tagged frame, they will not understand the VLAN tag and will drop 
	the frame. Also, the maximum legal Ethernet frame size for tagged frames was 
	increased in 802.1Q (and its companion, 802.3ac) from 1,518 to 1,522 bytes. 
	
	
	This could cause network interface cards and older switches to drop tagged
