        UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) is a distributed, open networking standard that uses TCP/IP for simple 
        peer-to-peer network connectivity between devices. A UPnP device can dynamically join a network, 
        obtain an IP address, convey its capabilities and learn about other devices on the network. 
      
      
        In turn, a device can leave a network smoothly and automatically when it is no longer in use.  
        UPnP broadcasts are only allowed on the LAN.<br>
        <b><i>Auto-Configure</i></b>&nbsp;
      
      
        UPnP network devices can automatically configure network addressing, announce their presence 
        in the network to other UPnP devices and enable exchange of simple product and service descriptions.
