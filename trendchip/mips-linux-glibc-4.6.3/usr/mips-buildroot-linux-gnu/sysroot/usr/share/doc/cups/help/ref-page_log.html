<P>The <VAR>page_log</VAR> file lists each page that is sent to a
printer. Each line contains the following information:</P>

<P CLASS="command">

printer user job-id date-time page-number num-copies job-billing<BR>

<BR>

DeskJet root 2 [20/May/1999:19:21:05 +0000] 1 1 acme-123<BR>

DeskJet root 2 [20/May/1999:19:21:05 +0000] 2 1 acme-123<BR>

</P>

<P>The <I>printer</I> field contains the name of the printer that
printed the page. If you send a job to a printer class, this
field will contain the name of the printer that was assigned the
job.</P>

<P>The <I>user</I> field contains the name of the user (the IPP
<CODE>requesting-user-name</CODE> attribute) that submitted this
file for printing.</P>

<P>The <I>job-id</I> field contains the job number of the page
being printed. Job numbers are reset to 1 whenever the spool
directory (<VAR>/var/spool/cups</VAR>) is cleared, so don't
depend on this number being unique!</P>

<P>The <I>date-time</I> field contains the date and time of when
the page started printing. The format of this field is identical
to the <I>data-time</I> field in the <VAR>access_log</VAR>
file.</P>

<P>The <I>page-number</I> and <I>num-pages</I> fields contain the
page number and number of copies being printed of that page. For
printers that cannot produce copies on their own, the
<I>num-pages</I> field will always be 1.</P>

<P>The <I>job-billing</I> field contains a copy of the
<CODE>job-billing</CODE> attribute provided with the IPP
<CODE>Create-Job</CODE> or <CODE>Print-Job</CODE> requests or "-"
if none was provided.
