<P>The Common UNIX Printing System<sup>TM</sup>, or CUPS, is the
software you use to print from applications like the web browser
you are using to read this page. It converts the <em>page
descriptions</em> produced by your application (put a paragraph
here, draw a line there, and so forth) into something your
printer can understand and then sends the information to the
printer for printing.</P>

<P>Now, since every printer manufacturer does things differently,
printing can be very complicated. CUPS does its best to hide this
from you and your application so that you can concentrate on
printing and less on <em>how</em> to print. Generally, the only
time you need to know anything about your printer is when you use
it for the first time, and even then CUPS can often figure things
out on its own.</P>

<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="WORK">How Does It Work?</A></H2>

<P>The first time you print to a printer, CUPS creates a
<em>queue</em> to keep track of the current status of the printer
(everything OK, out of paper, etc.) and any pages you have
printed. Most of the time the queue points to a printer connected
directly to your computer via a USB or parallel port, however it
can also point to a printer on your network, a printer on the
Internet, or multiple printers depending on the configuration.
Regardless of <em>where</em> the queue points, it will look like
any other printer to you and your applications.</P>

<P>Every time you print something, CUPS creates a <em>job</em>
which contains the queue you are sending the print to, the name
of the document you are printing, and the page descriptions. Job
are numbered (queue-1, queue-2, and so forth) so you can monitor
the job as it is printed or cancel it if you see a mistake. When
CUPS gets a job for printing, it determines the best programs
(<em>filters</em>, <em>printer drivers</em>, <em>port
monitors</em>, and <em>backends</em>) to convert the pages into a
printable format and then runs them to actually print the
job.</P>

<P>When the print job is completely printed, CUPS removes the job
from the queue and moves on to any other jobs you have submitted.
You can also be notified when the job is finished, or if there
are any errors during printing, in several different ways.</P>

<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="BEGIN">Where Do I Begin?</A></H2>

<P>Click on the <A HREF="/admin">Administration</A> tab at the
top of this page. If you have a printer connected to a USB or
parallel port, you will see it listed as a new printer - click on
the <VAR>Add This Printer</VAR> button, verify the printer driver
CUPS has chosen for you, and click on the <VAR>Add Printer</VAR>
button. If you do not see your printer listed, or if you have a
network printer, click on the <VAR>Add Printer</VAR> button and
follow the prompts.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If you are asked for a username and password, enter
your login username and password or the "root" username and
password. On MacOS X, the login username (or "short name") is
typically your first name in lowercase.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>After the printer is added, CUPS will ask you to set the
default printer options (paper size, output mode, etc.) for the
printer. Make any changes as needed and then click on the
<VAR>Set Printer Options</VAR> button to save them.</P>

<P>Finally, click on the <VAR>Print Test Page</VAR> button to
print a simple test page and verify that everything is working
properly.</P>

<P>Once you have added the printer, you can print to it from any
application.</P>
